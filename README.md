# conjugations
Gives you the conjugations of spanish verbs. I made this purely to have an easier life during my Spanish class so don't expect it to support all conjugations (yet), these are just the ones I needed to use in class.

## Installation

Download the ZIP file from the main github page!

## Usage

Set the path of your chromedriver in 'vervoeger.py':

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.PATH = "YOUR_PATH/chromedriver.exe"
```

And to run the script, use:

```bash
python3 INSTALL_LOCATION/main.py
```
