# conjugations
Gives you the conjugations of spanish verbs. I made this purely to have an easier life during my Spanish class so don't expect it to support all conjugations (yet), these are just the ones I needed to use in class.

How to use:
Set the path of your chromedriver in 'vervoeger.py', and run the project from the terminal with 'python3 vervoeger.py'

Enjoy!
